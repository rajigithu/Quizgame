Scenario:
- As a Boot Camp Instructor
I wish to create a timed quiz on CSS fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my student's progress compared to their peers.
Functionality:
- A student begins to take the test
- then they click a start button to begin the test
- then a timer starts and they presented with a question
- when they answer a question
-when they answered correctly they should notify they are awarded
- then they are presented with another question
- when they answer a question incorrectly
- then they receive a time penalty which subtracts from their remaining time
- when time runs out or all the questions are answered
- the quiz is over
- they are then given the option to save their information to join the leaderboard.
